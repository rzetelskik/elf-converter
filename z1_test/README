Run ./run.sh to build and execute all tests.
Each test is build from following parts:
- entrypoint (common.c),
- function list (*.flist),
- 64-bit part (*-64.c) and
- 32-bit part converted to 64-bit (*-32.c, *-32.s)

Tests:

multiargs - call 32->64 with different arguments
multiargs2 - call 64->32 with different aruments
retval - check proper passing of return values
recurse - recurse between 64-bit and 32-bit code
data - write 32-bit data from 64-bit
data2 - write 64-bit data from 32-bit
rodata - read 32-bit rodata from 64-bit code
rodata2 - read 64-bit rodata from 32-bit code
reg - test if 32-bit registers are properly restored
syscall - raw syscall to test if process is running in 32bit mode
